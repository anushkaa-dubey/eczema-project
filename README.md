# 🧴 ECZEMA DETECTION PROJECT

A simple machine learning-powered web app to detect **eczema** from skin images.

## 📁 Dataset

**Download here:**  
[Google Drive Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hjXKMEu9vwkfCY4uuha3Ewb5ueQtQ01x?usp=drive_link)  
Contains labeled skin images organized into:
- `eczema/`
- `normal/`

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. We trained a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model using labeled images of eczema and normal skin.
2. The model is deployed in a **Streamlit** web app for interactive image-based prediction.
3. Users upload a skin image.
4. The app preprocesses the image and predicts whether it's **eczema** or **normal**.
5. The result is displayed clearly on screen.

## 🤖 Models Used

We trained and tested multiple models to identify the best performer:

| Model                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **SVM**                | Best performance (~79.3% accuracy), used in deployed app                    |
| **Random Forest**      | Robust ensemble model, good with imbalanced data                            |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors**| Simple baseline model, less effective for image data                        |
| **MLP (Neural Net)**   | Basic neural network with 2 hidden layers, decent performance               |
| **CNN (Deep Learning)**| Custom CNN model trained with TensorFlow; limited due to hardware constraints |

🔍 *Only SVM is used in the current version of the app, but other models are available for experimentation.*

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd eczema_project
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. (Optional) Train the model from scratch
```bash
python model_train.py
```
This will retrain all models and generate `eczema_model.pkl`.

### 5. Run the Streamlit web app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 6. Use the App
Open the URL (e.g. http://localhost:8501) in your browser and:
- Upload a skin image
- Get instant prediction
- Try with different images for testing
